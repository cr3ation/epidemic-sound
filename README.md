### Client
Gather information about a macOS and sends inventory as json to `127.0.0.1:5000/computer/{serialnumber}`

## Installation
### Server
Begin with installing the server. See [server instructions](https://github.com/cr3ation/epidemic-sound/tree/master/server)

### Client
Install client _after_ server is created. See [client instructions](https://github.com/cr3ation/epidemic-sound/tree/master/client)
